        <h2>An Innovator's Trajectory</h2>
        <p>This section outlines the key milestones in Dr. Nemrodov's career, showing his evolution from a quantitative psychologist to a leader in applied neurotechnology. Click on any event to learn more about the core concepts and breakthroughs from that period.</p>

        <h3>1. Foundational Expertise (1996-2010)</h3>
        <p>Built a robust foundation in quantitative analysis through roles as a Polls Analyst and Transportation Psychologist, alongside a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience.</p>

        <h3>2. Post-Doctoral Specialization (2010-2014)</h3>
        <p>Mastered advanced electrophysiology (EEG, SSVEP) at labs in Waterloo and Louvain, focusing on the temporal dynamics of face recognition.</p>

        <h3>3. Breakthrough Innovation (2014-2020)</h3>
        <p>At the University of Toronto, fused neuroscience with machine learning to pioneer the reconstruction of visual images from EEG signals, a landmark achievement.</p>

        <h3>4. The Next Frontier (2020-Present)</h3>
        <p>As Director at Dandelion Science, leads the development of "Generative Neuromodulation" platforms for therapeutic applications, such as creating biomarkers for AMD.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>The Landmark Achievement</h2>
        <p>In 2018, Dr. Nemrodov and his colleagues published a groundbreaking study demonstrating the ability to reconstruct images of faces from non-invasive EEG signals. This section breaks down the technology, its significance, and the ethical discussions it sparked.</p>

        <h3>How It Works: From Brainwaves to Images</h3>
        <h4>1. Data Acquisition</h4>
        <p>A subject views face images while their brain's electrical activity is recorded with a standard EEG cap.</p>

        <h4>2. Model Training</h4>
        <p>Machine learning algorithms learn the complex patterns in EEG signals that correlate with specific facial features.</p>

        <h4>3. Image Reconstruction</h4>
        <p>The trained model uses new EEG data to generate a digital image of the face the subject is perceiving.</p>

        <h3>Why EEG was a Game-Changer</h3>
        <p>While image reconstruction was possible with fMRI, using EEG was a major leap forward, overcoming skepticism about the technology's fidelity.</p>

        <h4>Superior Temporal Resolution</h4>
        <p>EEG measures activity in milliseconds, allowing researchers to track the rapid formation of a mental image (est. 170ms).</p>

        <h4>Practicality & Accessibility</h4>
        <p>EEG systems are portable, affordable, and widely available compared to massive, expensive fMRI scanners, opening doors for real-world applications.</p>

        <h3>Public Profile & Ethical Questions</h3>
        <p>The work captured global media attention, often with "mind-reading" headlines. This sparked vital conversations about potential applications and ethics.</p>

        <h4>Potential Applications</h4>
        <p>Ideas included communication aids for non-verbal individuals and tools for law enforcement to visualize eyewitness memories.</p>

        <h4>Cognitive Liberty</h4>
        <p>Bioethicists raised concerns about the right to freedom of thought if internal mental states were no longer private, a debate Dr. Nemrodov himself encouraged.</p>

        <h2>The Next Frontier: Generative Neuromodulation</h2>
        <p>At Dandelion Science, Dr. Nemrodov's work has evolved from reading brain signals to actively guiding them. This section highlights a flagship project developing a novel biomarker for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), showcasing the power of this new therapeutic paradigm.</p>

        <h3>A New Biomarker for AMD</h3>
        <p>The team developed a method using frequency-tagged videos to precisely measure how the brain processes different types of visual information (e.g., fine details vs. coarse outlines). This is measured using Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP).</p>

        <p>The key finding was that the <strong>ratio</strong> of the brain's response to low-frequency (coarse) vs. high-frequency (detailed) information serves as a powerful, objective biomarker of AMD severity.</p>

        <p>The chart to the right visualizes this core finding, showing the significantly different neural response patterns between healthy individuals and AMD patients. This demonstrates a clear, measurable brain signal that correlates with the disease.</p>
